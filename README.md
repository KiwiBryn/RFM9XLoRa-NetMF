# RFM9XLoRa-NetMF
A C# library for LoRa[@LoRaAlliance](https://lora-alliance.org/) connectivity for Semtech [@SX127X](https://www.semtech.com/products/wireless-rf/lora-transceivers/SX1276)/HopeRF [@RFM9X](http://www.hoperf.com/rf_transceiver/lora/RFM95W.html) equipped shields on .NetMF device.

The repo has the source code for the series of blog posts written as I built this library
